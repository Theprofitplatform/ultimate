# PRD: Ultimate SEO Platform MVP Completion

## Executive Summary
Complete the Ultimate SEO Platform MVP by implementing missing core functionality, establishing proper development workflows, and creating a production-ready SaaS platform for SEO management with Google Workspace integration.

## Problem Statement
The platform is currently 25-30% complete with strong architectural foundations but missing critical implementation:
- No functional API endpoints beyond basic auth scaffolding
- Frontend exists but lacks integration with backend
- Database schema undefined despite Redis/PostgreSQL setup
- Google Workspace integration not implemented
- No working keyword research or SEO analysis features
- Missing multi-tenancy implementation
- Incomplete testing and deployment pipelines

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. Complete core API implementation with full CRUD operations
2. Implement Google Workspace integration (Sheets, Docs, Drive)
3. Build functional keyword research and analysis system
4. Establish multi-tenant architecture with proper isolation
5. Create comprehensive testing suite (>80% coverage)

### Success Metrics
- API endpoint completion: 100% of specified endpoints functional
- Test coverage: Minimum 80% for critical paths
- Performance: <200ms API response time for standard operations
- Security: Pass OWASP Top 10 security audit
- Deployment: Automated CI/CD with zero-downtime deployments
